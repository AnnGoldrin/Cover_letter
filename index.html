                <h2 class="specialty">Quality Assurance Engineer</h2>
                    <p> 20.11.2021
                    
                    <br> Hello, I'm Anna Matiukha. This email is in regard to my interest in applying for the QA Engineer position, recently posted on <a class="company-name" href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2593350969/?refId=42cd5ef3-f4fa-4810-ba57-c0103421b777&trk=flagship3_job_home_savedjobs">LinkedIn</a>.
                    <br><br>While pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology from Dnipro National University, I have developed skills in the attention to details and generally in computer technologies. This knowledge has enabled me to operate in Windows and MacOS platforms and get my first experience as a Trainee QA.
                    <br><br>My way as a QA engineer began from the practice in university. I established myself as a hardworking, goal-oriented and responsible trainee, so NOOSPHERE proposed work with them after my graduation. But I moved to another region after graduation and work assumed as an only office, so our paths diverged.
                    <br><br>I currently work as a QA Engineer in the PNN Soft, where I have been able to further strengthen my technical education. Here I gained an opportunity to work in a good team, that used in work such tools: Jira, Jenkins, Postman, SSMS, Soursetree, Xcode etc. My responsibilities include reporting and managing bugs, performing Web and API testing, creating test cases, and improving existing documentation systems.
                    <br><br>I'm interested in testing payments processing I've read about in Roman Savin book (Testing Dot Com). I read that this is your company’s core service.
                    <br>And I see that we have something in common, for example, your company is constantly innovating technology to help clients prepare their business for the future (same as I always choose the way of improving myself).
                    <br>I'll enjoy growth and development in such a good team! I have a strong desire to work in a company with such values and beliefs.
                    <br><br>I have attached my resume highlighting my academic and professional skills, and I look forward to hearing the answer from you.
                    <br><br>Sincerely,
                    <br>Anna Matiukha
